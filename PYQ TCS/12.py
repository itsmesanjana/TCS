# Q12. Jack is always excited about sunday. It is favourite day, when he gets to play all day. And goes to
# cycling with his friends.
# So every time when the months starts he counts the number of sundays he will get to enjoy.
# Considering
# the month can start with any day, be it Sunday, Mondayâ€¦. Or so on.
# Count the number of Sunday jack will get within n number of days.
# Example 1:
# Input
# mon-> input String denoting the start of the month.
# 13 -> input integer denoting the number of days from the start of the month.
# Output :
# 2 -> number of days within 13 days.

# Output
